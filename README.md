### **_Description_**

LitterLogic is an app and IOT solution that aims to both bring humor into your life, and help you monitor your cat's health.  Armed with simple PIR sensors, a cat's visit to the LitterBox will trigger two things: the power on an obnoxious LED sign (available for customization - think: "Occupied", "Pooping", "On Air") and an entry on your cat's LitterLogic Database detailing the time and duration of their visit.    

For older cats with kidney and digestive health issues, proactivity is of the essence, and LitterLogic arms you with data you need to discuss with your Vet how best to care for your furry loved ones while providing you, the owner, with some much needed comic relief.

### **_Technologies_**

#### 

LitterLogic will feature MEVN(?) stack technologies.  The backend will focus on:

- MongoDB for ingesting and storing User, Cat, and Trigger data (likely sourced from an SD card, Pre-MVP).   PostMVP solutions will aim to have mongodb backend ingest JSON output from arduino enabled PIR sensor > Hive MQ (cloud IOT solution).
- Express/Node as the web framework/server by which front and back ends are connected
